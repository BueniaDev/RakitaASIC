# FAQ 

**Q: Why is this project called RakitaASIC? I mean, it IS a bit of an odd name...** 

**A:** I know, I know. I kind agree with you on that. But the thing is, I have a certain tendency to name my projects after my favorite anime waifus. Specifically, this project is named in part after [this waifu](https://hitoribocchi-no-oo-seikatsu.fandom.com/wiki/Sotoka_Rakita).


**Q: What factors go into deciding which ASICs will be reverse-engineered?** 

**A:** Basically, if the silicon die shot of the ASIC is available on [this site](https://siliconpr0n.org/), and nobody else has stepped up to reverse-engineer the ASIC themselves, it's fair game for me!


**Q: What's your setup for decapping and imaging ASICs? I really want to know!** 

**A:** The truth is, I don't really have a setup like that yet. I mean, have you seen how expensive that stuff is, especially on my current income? However, I MAY end up creating a setup for basic decapping and imaging in the future. But for now at least, I'm just gonna leave the "decapping and imaging" parts to the pros that, you know, actually KNOW how to do it safely.
